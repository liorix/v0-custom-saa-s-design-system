## Atomic Design Structure

The design system follows atomic design principles:

- **UI Components**: Base components from shadcn/ui
- **Atoms**: Small, basic components like Logo, EmptyState, etc.
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms like FormField, StatCard, etc.
- **Organisms**: Complex components composed of molecules and atoms
- **Templates**: Page layouts that define content structure
- **Pages**: Specific implementations of templates
